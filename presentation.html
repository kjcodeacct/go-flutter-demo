# Golang & Flutter
![Logo](https://github.com/kjcodeacct/golang_flutter_demo/raw/master/assets/goflutter.png)

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->
# Prerequisites
 * ✅ Know golang 
 * ✅ Have introductory knowledge of MVVM, MVC, MVP, etc (UI development) 

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->

# What is this exactly?
This is a great way to develop truly cross platform desktop and mobile applications rapidly, and beautifly.

It's an intersection between:
* Flutter's approach to declarative UI.
* Golang's great performant and system level language.


Powered by the [go-flutter project](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter)

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->

# Who is this for?
This is for anyone who wants to build an application *with* a modern UI.

This could range from any of the following situations:
* You have a mobile app you want to release on desktop.
* Want to release a golang based app *without* electron or html.
* You know golang, and want to get into mobile development or vice-versa.

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->

# Why?

## Flutter
* Flutter is a great UI oriented language, for rapidly getting to production across *all* platforms.

* Has a great UI standard that renders natively on everythin from linux to IOS.

* Desktop support for dart/flutter is spotty, and unofficially in beta.


## Golang
* Golang is a great system oriented language, for getting robust and fast (enough) code onto *all* platforms.

* Has no real official UI tooling or even officially recommened UI.

* Has primarily been developed with cli and server based applications in mind.

# Quick Comparison
### What else is available

* GTK <https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3>
    * desktop focused
* Nuklear <https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear>
    * desktop focused
* Fyne <https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne>
    * basic mobile implementation (lacks sensor data, etc)
* QT <https://github.com/therecipe/qt>
    * fairly complete mobile implementation

Please note this is a list of packages I've used *personally*.

# Pros & Cons
## *AKA is this too hipster for production*?

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->

# Pros & Cons

## Pros
* Great workflow, can build and package a release for any platform (desktop, mobile, embedded) in moments.

* Flutters UI is declaritive and a part of the business logic. No need to fuss with widget declarations, complex callbacks, async threads, etc.

* Can target any desktop specific features with golang, and provide any mobile specific features with flutter/golang-mobile.
    * Can also have 2 seperate UI's for mobile and desktop experiences.

* Flutter has been proven to be a stable platform for many of the large companies seen at <https://flutter.dev/showcase>

---

<!-- class: left, middle -->

# Pros & Cons

## Cons
* [go-flutter](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) is unofficial.

* Flutter is less popular than kotlin, swift, and react-native, leading to a smaller community (currently)

* Flutter is a new technology. Sometimes that's scary, and a hard sell.

* Google occasionally likes to [kill nice things](https://killedbygoogle.com/)
    * Should be noted Google dog-foods flutter for everything from Google Ads to Stadia.

# Go Mobile

## Will this bring all of the cool features go offers to mobile?
Yes, mostly.

Limitations:
* Go mobile lacks some features
    * not all packages are compatible, and assume a desktop environment

# Is this too hipster for production?

### TLDR; **No**

* Essentially go-flutter at its core is just ~ 200 lines of code to compile to C byte code with GLFW support
    * This is **not** complex, at an implementation level, just fancy tooling
    * see <https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/tree/640dcea647f47ceca0e3fb67166d2ea124a09f24>
* All API's going to future flutter versions are deprecated but still functional
    * **ANY** currently working features will not break.
    * Go here for more information on flutter API versioning and compatibility policy

# Go-Flutter Tooling

## Flutter 
Flutter provides a CLI tool to build and package mobile & web applications.

List of commonly used commands:
```
# create your flutter app
$ flutter create golang_flutter_demo
```
```
# run your flutter app (android/ios)
$ flutter run
```
```
# build your bundled flutter app (android/ios)
# stores builds in golang_flutter_demo/build/app/outputs
$ flutter build apk
$ flutter build ios
```

---

<!-- class: left, top -->

# Go-Flutter Tooling

## Hover
Hover is the CLI tool that implements basic running, building and packaging a go-flutter application.

The options below match those provided by flutter:
```
# add desktop support to your flutter app
$ hover init
```
```
# run your golang flutter app (in native env)
$ hover run
```
```
# build your bundled go-flutter app
# stores builds in golang_flutter_demo/go/build/outputs
$ hover build linux
$ hover build macos
$ hover build windows
```

# Go-Flutter "Plugins"

What is a "plugin" ?
* It sounds fancy, but it's just an interface between go & dart.

## An example plugin
https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples/tree/master/plugin_tutorial/go-plugin-example/complex

---

# Demo
* Go to golang_flutter_demo directory
* Run and build the app
    * ```hover run```

---

# Demo

# Finally Some Code!

Lets see what it takes to run this.


--- 

# Creating the Binding

## Plugin

Create a go package with plugin bindings
> gophershop/image_editor/main.go

```go
func (this *Editor) InitPlugin(messenger plugin.BinaryMessenger) error {

	channel := plugin.NewMethodChannel(messenger, channelName, plugin.StandardMethodCodec{})
	channel.HandleFunc("editImage", this.parseEdit)
	return nil
}
```
---
# Creating the Binding

## Register the Plugin

Add package
> go/cmd/options.go
```go
flutter.AddPlugin(&image_editor.Editor{}),
```

---

# Using the Binding

Call the plugin binding you made from your flutter code
> lib/main.dart
```dart
static const image_editor_lib = const MethodChannel('gophershop/image_editor');
...
...
loadedImagePath = await image_editor_lib.invokeMethod("editImage", jsonText);
```

---

# Quick Tips on Writing Plugins
* use a common formats for communication i.e not raw structs
    * json, protobuffs, etc
* write go code the same way as you would normally, error handling etc.
    * the plugin is not special, write it with your standard good practices for golang
* if you are concerned about the layout mobile v desktop
    * mobile - main.dart
    * desktop - main_desktop.dart

---

# Whats Next ?
1. Checkout the [golang_flutter_demo repo](https://github.com/kjcodeacct/golang_flutter_demo)
2. Add a different image editing feature from the [provided image package](https://github.com/anthonynsimon/bild)
3. Test the go-flutter build system and see if it's right for you.
4. ???
4. Become a hermit for the weekend and make a really cool app with go-flutter.
