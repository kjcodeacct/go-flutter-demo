# Golang & Flutter

# What is this exactly?
This is a great way to develop truly cross platform desktop applications rapidly, and beautifly.

It's an intersection between:
* Flutter's approach to declarative UI.
* Golang's great performant and system level language.


Powered by the [go-flutter project](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter)

# Who is this for?
This is for anyone who wants to build an application *with* a modern UI.

This could range from any of the following situations:
* You have a mobile app you want to release on desktop.
* Want to release a golang based app *without* electron or html.
* You know golang, and want to get into mobile development or vice-versa.

---
# Why?

## Flutter
* Flutter is a great UI oriented language, for rapidly getting to production across *all* platforms.

* Has a great UI standard that renders natively on everythin from linux to IOS.

* Desktop support for dart/flutter is spotty, and unofficially in beta.


## Golang
* Golang is a great system oriented language, for getting robust and fast (enough) code onto *all* platforms.

* Has no real official UI tooling or even officially recommened UI.

* Has primarily been developed with cli and server based applications in mind.

# Pros & Cons

# Pros & Cons

## Pros
* Great workflow, can build and package a release for any platform in moments.

* Flutters UI is declaritive and a part of the business logic. No need to fuss with widget declarations, complex callbacks, async threads, etc.

* Can target any OS specific features with golang, and provide a clean interface across platforms with Flutter.

* Flutter has been proven to be a stable platform for many of the large companies seen at <https://flutter.dev/showcase>

---
# Pros & Cons

## Cons
* [go-flutter](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) is unofficial.

* Flutter is less popular than kotlin, swift, and react-native, leading to a smaller community (currently)

* Flutter is a new technology. Sometimes that's scary, and a hard sell.

* Google occasionally likes to [kill nice things](https://killedbygoogle.com/)
    * Should be noted Google dog-foods flutter for everything from Google Ads to Stadia.

# Is this too hipster for production?

### TLDR; **No**

* Essentially go-flutter is just ~ 200 lines of code to compile to C byte code with GLFW support
    * I.E. this is not complex, at a language level, just fancy tooling
* All API's going to future flutter versions are deprecated but still functional
    * **ANY** currently working features will not break.
